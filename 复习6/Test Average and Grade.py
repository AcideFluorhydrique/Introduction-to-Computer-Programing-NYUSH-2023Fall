"""
Write a program that asks the user to enter five test scores. 
The program should display a letter grade for each score and the average test score. 
Write the following functions in the program:


â€¢ calc_average - This function should accept five test scores 
as arguments and return the average of the scores.


â€¢ determine_grade - This function should accept a test score as an argument and 
return a letter grade for the score based on the following grading scale:
